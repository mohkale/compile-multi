A rewrite of [[https://github.com/ReanGD/emacs-multi-compile][multi-compile]] providing a simpler and more feature-full experience.

This package provides a command that can be used to run compilation commands that
match one or more predicates for the current directory or project. This can be used
for example to list all of the makefile targets of a project and then execute one.

* Installation
** Manually
   1. Clone the repo.
   2. Add the repo path to your emacs ~load-path~.
   3. Load it when needed.

** From MELPA
   TODO: Melpa support.

** straight
   You can also install this package through the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]] package manager.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (straight-use-package '(compile-multi :host github
                                           :repo "mohkale/compile-multi"))
   #+end_src

* Deviations from emacs-multi-compile
  This package isn't a copy of [[https://github.com/ReanGD/emacs-multi-compile][emacs-multi-compile]], it's a lighter and more
  feature-full re-write. The main changes from upstream are:
  + No special formatting-directives/percent-sequences. Commands are lisp lists
    that are evaluated, shell-quoted and concatenated together smartly.
  + Support for dynamic command generation (such as from Makefiles) which can let you
    use this package as a replacement for [[https://github.com/abo-abo/helm-make][helm-make]] and as a convenient base for
    other such build frameworks.
  + Support for lisp functions as direct compilation functions. For example
    rustic-mode provides its own wrappers around compile, test and run and this
    package can let you interface with those as well.

* Configuration
  The main configuration for ~compile-multi~ is ~compile-multi-config~. This should be an
  alist with the ~car~ being the something matching current file, buffer or simply a
  list form that can evaluates to true. The ~cdr~ should be a list of tasks/actions
  that users can select when the trigger fires. An action is an cons of the action
  name and something to be done when that action is selected.

  Here's an example of the general layout of the configuration variable.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq
     compile-multi-config '((trigger-1
                             ("action1" . command-1)
                             ("action2" . command-2))
                            (trigger-2
                             ("action1" . command-1)
                             ("action2" . command-2))))
  #+end_src

** Triggers
   Triggers can be mode-symbols, strings, interpreted as regexps for the
   buffer-file-name or if the buffer has no file name then its buffer-name, or any
   lisp form that is triggered when it evaluates to true.

   This can be used alongside ~(setq compile-multi-default-directory #'projectile-project-root)~
   to setup trigger based on project files.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (push '((file-exists-p "Makefile")
             ("make:build" . "make build")
             ("make:test" . "make test")
             ("make:all" . "make all"))
           compile-multi-config)
   #+end_src

** Actions
   As a special case an action can be inserted as a function instead of an cons cell.
   When this is the case the function will be called and expected to return a
   collection of actions to be put in place of the functions position in the
   configuration.

   For example ~compile-multi-make~ provides a function that'll parse out all the
   targets from a Makefile and generate actions for them.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'compile-multi-make)

     (push `((file-exists-p "Makefile")
             ("action-1" . command-1)
             ,#'compile-multi-make-targets
             ("action-2" . command-2))
           compile-multi-config)
   #+end_src

   When written as an alist the ~car~ of an action must always be the action name. The
   ~cdr~ can vary depending on what the user wants.

   When it's a string then the string is taken as a shell command to run for
   compilation.
   When a list each argument of the list is evaluated, shell-quoted and then
   concatenated together.
   *Note*: We don't shell quote strings, only evaluated lisp forms.
   *Note*: Symbols can be replaced instead of evaluated using ~compile-multi-forms~.
   For example

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (push `(python-mode
             ("python:pylint" "python3" "-m" "pylint" (buffer-file-name)))
           compile-multi-config)
   #+end_src

   Lastly the action can be a function. In this case the function is called when the
   action is selected. For example:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defun byte-compile-this-file+ ()
       (byte-compile-file (buffer-file-name)))

     (push `(emacs-lisp-mode
             ("emacs:bytecompile" . ,#'byte-compile-this-file+))
           compile-multi-config)
   #+end_src
