;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines a keymap and embark transformer helper to integrate
;; compile-multi into embark. This lets you set command actions that will
;; run on the underlying command shown in a `compile-multi' session.

;;; Code:

(require 'embark)

(defgroup compile-multi-embark nil
  "Integration between `compile-multi' and `embark'."
  :group 'compile-multi)

(defvar compile-multi-embark-command-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (set-keymap-parent map embark-general-map)
    (define-key map "e" #'compile-multi-embark-edit)
    (define-key map "g" #'recompile)
    map)
  "Keymap active in `compile-multi' `embark' sessions.")



(defun compile-multi-embark-transformer (type target)
  "Transformer for `embark' to convert a `compile-multi' TARGET into a command.
TYPE should always be `compile-multi'."
  (cl-assert (eq type 'compile-multi) 'show-args
             "This transformer should only be used with `compile-multi'.")
  (let ((command (get-text-property 0 'compile-multi--task target)))
    (cl-assert command 'show-args "Encountered compile-multi candidate with no command")
    (cons type command)))

(defun compile-multi-embark-edit (cmd)
  "Edit before running `compile' on CMD."
  (cond
   ((stringp cmd) (compile (compilation-read-command cmd)))
   ((functionp cmd) (eval-expression (read--expression "Eval: " (format "(%s)" cmd))))
   (t (error "Don't know how to run the command %s" cmd))))

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode compile-multi-embark-mode
  "Minor mode enabling `embark' actions for `compile-multi' minibuffer sessions."
  :global t :group 'compile-multi-embark
  (if compile-multi-embark-mode
      (progn
        (push '(compile-multi compile-multi-embark-command-map) embark-keymap-alist)
        (push `(compile-multi . ,#'compile-multi-embark-transformer)
              embark-transformer-alist))
    (setq embark-keymap-alist (assq-delete-all 'compile-multi embark-keymap-alist)
          embark-transformer-alist (assq-delete-all 'compile-multi embark-transformer-alist))))
